      <h2>What is this website?</h2>
      <p>
        RentorBuyCalculator.net is a free, independent web tool that helps you compare the long-term
        cost of renting versus buying a home. Instead of guessing based on only the monthly payment,
        the calculator includes key factors like:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Monthly rent and expected yearly rent increases</li>
        <li>Home price, down payment and mortgage interest rate</li>
        <li>Property taxes, maintenance and insurance estimates</li>
        <li>Total cost of renting and buying over your chosen time horizon</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The goal is to give you a clear, numbers-based view of each option so you can make your own
        informed decision.
      </p>

      <h2>Who is behind the site?</h2>
      <p>
        RentorBuyCalculator.net is a small, independent project created by a solo developer who
        enjoys building practical tools for everyday financial decisions. There is no real-estate
        company, bank, or broker sponsoring this calculator.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because this is an independent project, the calculator is designed to be:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Neutral:</strong> it does not push you toward renting or buying.</li>
        <li><strong>Simple:</strong> only the most important inputs are required.</li>
        <li><strong>Transparent:</strong> assumptions are visible and editable by you.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>Important disclaimer</h2>
      <p>
        This website does <strong>not</strong> provide financial, tax, or investment advice.
        The calculator is a general educational tool based on simplified assumptions and public
        information. Your real situation may differ significantly based on your market, income,
        credit profile and tax situation.
      </p>
      <p>
        You should always consult with a qualified professional (such as a financial advisor,
        mortgage specialist or tax advisor) before making major financial decisions.
