  <h1>About RentorBuyCalculator.net</h1>
  <p><strong>RentorBuyCalculator.net</strong> is a simple tool that helps you compare the long-term cost of renting versus buying a home.</p>

  <h2>Why this calculator exists</h2>
  <p>Many people make the rent vs buy decision based only on the monthly payment. In reality, there are many other costs: interest, property taxes, maintenance, insurance, and rising rent. This calculator brings those numbers together so you can see the bigger picture.</p>

  <h2>How it works</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Estimates total rent paid over time, including yearly rent increases.</li>
    <li>Calculates mortgage payments for your chosen interest rate and loan term.</li>
    <li>Adds approximate property tax and maintenance percentages.</li>
    <li>Shows which option is cheaper over your selected time horizon.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Who is behind the site?</h2>
  <p>This project is run by an independent developer who enjoys building practical finance tools. The goal is to keep the calculator fast, free, and easy to use.</p>
